Hi ğŸ˜€

I would like to add a few details about the requierments:

1. I have slightly changed the design, because I have added the sidebar, so I have aligned the headings to the left.

2. The separators between artists names work as they should ( commas between all items and & before the last one ), but I don't think that current data contains an album with more then 2 artists, so I have tested it with some dummy data.

And the link is https://earnest-pavlova-13c952.netlify.app/.

Thank you!

Best,
Viktoria
